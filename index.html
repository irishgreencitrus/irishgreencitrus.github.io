I make games using the godot game engine and websites like this. This website is built with three.js and vite, which is what i'm learning right now.</section><section class=languages><h2>Programming languages</h2>These are my top programming languages in order of my opinion.<ol reversed><li><h3>Vimscript</h3>Pros: Good for vim config<br>Cons: Cannot be used outside vim</li><li><h3>C++</h3>Pros: Really fast and low level<br>Cons: Really hard to program fast, and is generally a pain</li><li><h3>CSS</h3>Pros: It's really your only choice for styling. Programming language? Debatable<br>Cons: Why is it so hard to center a div. It's unnecessary and bad</li><li><h3>HTML</h3>Pros: It's your only choice for websites, or simple ones at least. It's also basically self documenting<br>Cons: Not really designed for websites anymore. This page wouldn't even be able to look like this if it wasn't for JS and CSS</li><li><h3>C</h3>Pros: Faster and more simplistic than C++<br>Cons: Kinda hard to do anything unspecific, compiling is still a pain</li><li><h3>Lua</h3>Pros: Hyper simplistic, and it just works<br>Cons: I don't really know as I haven't used lua that much</li><li><h3>JavaScript</h3>Pros: Universal language now, and can do cool things<br>Cons: Got some weird specialities</li><li><h3>Rust</h3>Pros: Basically C++ 2, and it's way easier to compile and manage. It's also just as fast and has safety and stuff<br>Cons: Code is hard to read</li><li><h3>Python</h3>Pros: Hyper easy to prototype and code, runs anywhere without compilation<br>Cons: If you're building something complex in it there's no reason to not move to another language</li><li><h3>Go</h3>Pros: Compiles into basically anything, is really quick and is good at parallelism<br>Cons: Has some weird syntax at times like the only loop being a for loop, which seems weird coming from python</li></ol></section></main></body></html>
